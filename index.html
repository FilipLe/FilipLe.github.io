                    <div class="text-block-41">As part of the <u><i>Boston Hacks</i></u> competition, my team and I decided to create an alert system program that collects weather forecast information and sends users SMS 
                        text alerts reminding them suitable wear. We utilised the <u><i>Open Weather API</i></u> to retrieve weather forecast information within the upcoming 72 hours in our program and we made sure that 
                        the program refreshes every 6 hours so that the user is up-to-date with weather conditions and wears suitable clothes for that weather. We used <u><i>SMTP Protocol Client API</i></u> to create client 
                        session object that can be used to send users SMS text alerts of the weather and the clothing suggestion. </div>

                    <div class="text-block-39">Property appraisal is one of the most taxing task, especially in a rapidly changing property market nowadays, because it is a fairly imprecise discipline 
                        due to reliance on the unique features of the real estate property such as its location, size, property type, and economy growth. Achieving consistency in real estate appraisal 
                        is difficult; hence why, we wanted to build a solution that is capable of predicting the house prices better and with greater consistency and precision than human appraisers. 
                        <br><br/>To explore this issue, we built <i>Machine Learning</i> models such as <u>K-Nearest Neighbors</u> and <u>Decision Trees Classifier Models</u> and used our classifier 
                        models with <u>DataFrames</u> on the given metrics to manipulate and evaluate our data to determine an approximate predicted valuation of a property.<span>‍</span>
